The Ford-Johnson algorithm, also known as "Merge-Insertion,"
is a comparison sorting algorithm that aims to minimize the number of comparisons needed to sort a list.
It was developed by L.R. Ford and S.M. Johnson in 1959
and is particularly notable because
it achieves an optimal number of comparisons for small numbers of elements,
though it is less commonly used in practice today
compared to more well-known algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort.


How the Algorithm Works:
The Ford-Johnson algorithm operates by a clever combination of
merge sorting and insertion sorting principles.
Here's a high-level overview:

Divide and Conquer:
The list is divided into pairs of elements.
Each pair is compared, and the smaller of the two is placed into a "sorted" list,
while the larger elements are set aside for later insertion.

Recursive Sorting:
The smaller sorted list is recursively sorted,
while the larger elements are inserted into
their correct positions within this sorted list using a binary search.

Merging:
The process of inserting the larger elements involves
finding their correct position within the sorted list and placing them there,
minimizing the number of comparisons.

Insertion:
Finally, the larger elements that were set aside
are inserted into their correct positions in the sorted list.

Why It's Useful:
The Ford-Johnson algorithm is useful in situations
where the number of comparisons is critical, especially for small lists.
The algorithm is provably optimal for small input sizes,
meaning it uses the fewest possible comparisons to sort the list.
For larger datasets, other algorithms like MergeSort or QuickSort
tend to be more practical due to their better average-case performance
and simpler implementation.

(Making sure it is not some other algo)

1. Review the Number of Comparisons:
Ford-Johnson:
The hallmark of Ford-Johnson is its optimization for the number of comparisons,
particularly for small lists.
If the code is tracking and minimizing comparisons meticulously,
it might indicate the use of Ford-Johnson or a similar algorithm.
Other Algorithms:
Compare the number of comparisons to known values for other algorithms
(e.g., MergeSort, Insertion Sort, etc.).
If the number aligns with a different sorting algorithmâ€™s pattern, that might be a clue.

2. Examine the Code Structure:
Pairing and Recursive Sorting:
Ford-Johnson begins by pairing elements
and recursively sorting smaller parts of the list
before inserting larger elements.

Look for code that explicitly handles element pairs,
recursive sorting, and careful insertion.

Merging Steps:
The merging and insertion steps in Ford-Johnson are quite specific.
If you see code that diverges from this,
such as using straightforward merging without pair-based partitioning,
it might suggest another algorithm.

3. Check for Binary Insertion:
Binary Search for Insertion:
Ford-Johnson uses binary search to place elements in their correct positions.
If the implementation uses binary search heavily during insertion phases,
it might indicate Ford-Johnson or a similar technique.
Linear Insertion:
If the insertion phase is more linear and not optimized through binary search,
it might be closer to a basic insertion sort or another non-Ford-Johnson method.
